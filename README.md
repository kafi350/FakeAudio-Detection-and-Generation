# FakeAudio Detection

It is a fake audio detection application. For this project two vital stages are considered. First of all, the deep fake audio generation part where the fake audios are created and then the deep fake audio detection part where the fake audios are detected using CNN.

Firts, clone the project and install conda.&#x20;

```
// sudo install conda
```

Next, run the generation.py which will generate fake audios by taking the voice comman or any audio file (format .wav). After this, run the detection part to detect the fake audios.&#x20;
